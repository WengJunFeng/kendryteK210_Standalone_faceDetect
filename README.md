This is a face detection/tracking demo using the Kendryte K210 chip, with the Standalone SDK. Excellent performance and low power consumption.

The intial code (modified) from here:
https://github.com/kendryte/kendryte-standalone-demo/tree/develop/face_detect

Built with Visual Studio Code (platform IO extension).

In order to get this working, I had to copy the lib folder from:
https://github.com/kendryte/kendryte-standalone-sdk

into the (windows) User\.platformio\packages\framework-kendryte-standalone-sdk\lib
